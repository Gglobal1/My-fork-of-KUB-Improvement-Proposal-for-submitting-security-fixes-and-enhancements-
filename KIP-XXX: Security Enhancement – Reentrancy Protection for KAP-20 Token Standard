## Summary
This PR adds a new KIP proposing the integration of reentrancy protection into the KAP-20 token standard.  
It introduces a `nonReentrant` modifier and follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent malicious re-entry calls during token operations.

## Motivation
Reentrancy vulnerabilities have been exploited in multiple high-profile attacks across blockchain platforms, resulting in significant losses. This proposal strengthens KAP-20 security, protects user funds, and aligns the standard with industry best practices.

## Changes
- Adds KIP-XXX markdown file in the KIPs folder.
- Outlines technical approach, rationale, and backward compatibility.
- Includes example Solidity code for easy adoption.

## Impact
- **Security:** Significantly reduces risk of reentrancy-based attacks.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Fully compatible with existing KAP-20 implementations.
- **Developer Guidance:** Clear reference implementation and recommended usage.
